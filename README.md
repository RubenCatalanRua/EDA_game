# EDA GAME - The Walking Dead
My player for the Q1-2022/23 EDA competition, which consisted of a 4-player game where we played as a group of survivors in a "Walking Dead"-styled environment. 
The objective being to amass the most amount of points possible by killing enemies, zombies, and covering the maps with tiles of your team color.
